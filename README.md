# StockMAN
A simple Stock Management application written in Smalltalk using the Seaside framework and GLORP.

Intended originally as the beginnings of a 'Stock Management' application this project is now discontinued. The code will remain as a reference point for future developments. A new StockMAN application has been started - please see CT-StockMAN.
